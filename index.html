          <h3>About Me</h3>
           <p class="center-text">While in grade school, I  first acquired an interest in programming when using CSS and HTML to customize various social media pages for me and my friends. In college, I successfully converted my Chromebook into a gaming compatible computer. I realized that I loved working behind the scenes and working hard to make a program do what I want it to do.</p>
           <p class="center-text">I am eager to become part of a team and grow within a company that will help me develop my skills. I believe that Thinkful will help me tremendously on this journey! I am a very fast learner and eager to gain as much knowledge as possible.</p>
           <p class="center-text">I am a creative person as well, I draw and play games in my spare time. I plan on using these hobbies to aid in the development of my new career path.</p>
